### Overview

*Stochastic blockmodels* (SBMs) contributed to the theoretical and
algorithmic developments for analyzing *network* data, which has been
facilitated by the availability of data in diverse fields like *social
sciences*, *web recommender systems*, *protein networks*, *genomics*,
and *neuroscience*. SBMs being the generalization of the Erdős-Rényi
model given by [Erdős and Rényi
(1960)](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400841356.38) was proposed
originally in context of *social sciences* for directed and undirected
graphs, whereas now it has been vastly extended and uitlized in *latent
blocks in undirected graphs*, *latent space models*, *variable degree
distribution*, *dynamically evolving networks*, etc., becoming one of
the more popular approaches to model network data in computer science,
statistics and machine learning.
