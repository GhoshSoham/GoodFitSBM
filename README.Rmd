### NEWS

GoodFitSBM (Version 0.0.1): `GoodFitSBM` comprises functionality that performs the *goodness-of-fit* test for an **beta-SBM** (one of the three variants of SBMs discussed in [Karwa et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkad084) used for modelling network data.


### Note


### Overview

*Stochastic blockmodels* (SBMs) contributed to the theoretical and algorithmic developments for analyzing *network* data, which has been facilitated by the availability of data in diverse fields like *social sciences*, *web recommender systems*, *protein networks*, *genomics*, and *neuroscience*. SBMs being the generalization of the Erdős-Rényi model given by [Erdős and Rényi (1960)](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400841356.38) was proposed originally in context of *social sciences* for directed and undirected graphs, whereas now it has been vastly extended and utilized in *latent blocks in undirected graphs*, *latent space models*, *variable degree distribution*, *dynamically evolving networks*, etc., becoming one of the more popular approaches to model network data in computer science, statistics and machine learning.

[Karwa et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkad084) addresses a very important aspect of *model fitting* by constructing goodness-of-fit tests (under finite-sample setting) for three variants of SBMs respectively used for modeling network data (where model adequacy procedures are somewhat elusive in general), viz., *Erdős-Rényi SBM* (ER-SBM), *Additive SBM*, and *beta-SBM*, where the main idea revolves around a *frequentist conditional goodness-of-fit test* conditioned on a sufficient statistic ([Karwa et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkad084) also illustrates its Bayesian counterpart).


### Intended Use of the package `GoodFitSBM`

Out of the three variants of the SBMs in ([Karwa et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkad084)) to model network data, `GoodfitSBM` addresses goodness-of-fit test under the framework of a **beta-SBM**. With a focus on *simple undirected*, and *unweighted* networks (graphs) having *no self-loop*, the package comprises of four functions viz., `get_mle()`, `goftest()`, `graphchi()`, and `sample_a_move()` - among which `goftest()` performs the major functionality of performing the goodness-of-fit test, in process, obtains the value of the chi-square test statistic and the corresponding $p-$value, after proper sampling of the graph (a Markov move or basis) - done by the function `sample_a_move()` under the beta-SBM framework. Computation of the chi-square test statistic value under the beta-SBM framework is done by `graphchi()`, which in turn requires the estimates (maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in our case) of the edge probabilities $q_{ij}$ between block $B_i$ and block $B_j$ as, $\widehat{q}_{ij}$, which is done by the function `get_mle()`.

The corresponding $p-$value obtained from `goftest()` are further analysed to examine the extent of fit of the beta-SBM to the given network (graph) (usual rule applies to reject the null of a good fit when, $p \leq \alpha$ at level $0< \alpha < 1$). There are other functions collated, each performing the required functionality in the process, see [GoodFitSBM Github Repo](https://github.com/Roy-SR-007/GoodFitSBM/tree/master/R) for details.


### The beta-SBM and Related Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) Framework

In this section, we outline the theoretical part on which the entire package `GoodFitSBM` is based.

#### Stochastic Blockmodels (SBMs)

Consider $G$ to be a graph on $n$ nodes, $g$ being its realization. It is assumed that, all graphs are *unweighted* and *undirected*, and there are *no self-loops*. Therefore, the graph $G$ can also be referred to by its $n\times n$ adjacency matrix, $\mathbf{g}$, where $g_{uv} = 1$, if there is an edge between node $u$ and $v$ in the graph $\mathbf{g}$, and $0$ otherwise.

An *exponential family random graph model (ERGM)* assumes that the probability of observing a graph $\mathbf{g}$ depends only on a vector of sufficient statistics, $T(\mathbf{g})$, i.e., the probability of observing a given network $G=\mathbf{g}$ is,

$
\mathbb{P}_{\theta}(G=\mathbf{g}) = \frac{exp{\langle T(\mathbf{g}), \theta\rangle}}{\psi(\theta)}
$
where $\psi(\theta) = \sum_{\mathbf{g}}exp(\langle T(\mathbf{g}), \theta\rangle)$ is the normalizing constant, $\theta \in \Theta$ is a vector of natural parameters, and $T(\mathbf{g})$ is the vector of minimal sufficient statistics for the underlying model. Let $p_{uv}$ be the probability of an edge between node $u$ and node $v$, where it is assumed that, $g_{uv}\sim \mbox{Bernoulli}(p_{uv})$
