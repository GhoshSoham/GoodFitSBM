### Overview

*Stochastic blockmodels* (SBMs) contributed to the theoretical and algorithmic developments for analyzing *network* data, which has been facilitated by the availability of data in diverse fields like *social sciences*, *web recommender systems*, *protein networks*, *genomics*, and *neuroscience*. SBMs being the generalization of the Erdős-Rényi model given by [Erdős and Rényi (1960)](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400841356.38) was proposed originally in context of *social sciences* for directed and undirected graphs, whereas now it has been vastly extended and utilized in *latent blocks in undirected graphs*, *latent space models*, *variable degree distribution*, *dynamically evolving networks*, etc., becoming one of the more popular approaches to model network data in computer science, statistics and machine learning.

[Karwa et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkad084) addresses a very important aspect of *model fitting* by constructing goodness-of-fit tests (under finite-sample setting) for three variants of SBMs respectively used for modeling network data (where model adequacy procedures are somewhat elusive in general), viz., *Erdős-Rényi SBM* (ER-SBM), *Additive SBM*, and *$\beta-$SBM*, where the main idea revolves around a *frequentist conditional goodness-of-fit test* conditioned on a sufficient statistic ([Karwa et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssb/qkad084) also illustrates its Bayesian counterpart).
