### Overview

*Stochastic blockmodels* (SBMs) contributed to the theoretical and algorithmic developments for analyzing *network* data, which has been facilitated by the availability of data in diverse fields like *social sciences*, *web recommender systems*, *protein networks*, *genomics*, and *neuroscience*. SBMs being the generalization of the Erdős-Rényi model given by [Erdős and Rényi (1960)](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400841356.38) was proposed originally in context of *social sciences* for directed and undirected graphs, whereas now it has been vastly extended and uitlized in *latent blocks in undirected graphs*, *latent space models*, *variable degree distribution*, *dynamically evolving networks*, etc., becoming one of the more popular approaches to model network data in computer science, statistics and machine learning.
